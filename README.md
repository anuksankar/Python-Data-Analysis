### Excerpt : Year-over-Year Seasonal Variation of Crime

 <br> </br>
 Various crimes peak during different months.  The correlation between the seasons (temperatures) and when the crimes peak seem to be strong.  We had a hypothesis that crimes and especially theft could increase during the holiday season (Novemeber, December) when families travel, but the data doesn't bear that relationship.   So it can be concluded that theft does not increase substantially during the holidays.
